# social-cpd


Assessing change point detection (CPD):
The task is designed to measure learning in social versus non-social domains and whether change point detection is slower in the social domain.

The participant is shown a number line (0-50), with each number positioned in a box.
The participant's task is to predict the outcome of the next trial (e.g., how much money will be assigned to them by another participant on the next trial).
To indicate their prediction, they click on a number. Once they do so, the corresponding box is outlined. Next, they provide a range to indicate their confidence
interval within which they believe the next outcome will fall. This is shown by vertical lines at the high and low ends of the confidence interval.
In the last part of each trial, they are shown the actual outcome, which is indicated by highlighting the corresponding box
(the outcome is drawn from a normal distribution with a specific mean and standard deviation).
They are then shown feedback in the form of points proportional to how close their mean estimate was to the actual outcome.
